Happy New Year from behalf of PyTim!

The first #Python meetup of 2014 will take place on February 11. The
format is the same as in the previous meet ups.

Here is the Agenda:

• Radu Ciorba (`3Pillar Global Romania`_) - "Concurrency in Python
Overview: Processes, Threads and Greenlets"

• Adam Collard (`Canonical Ltd`_) - "Python 3.4. What's coming?"

• Alessandro Pilotti (`Cloudbase Solutions`_) - "Interoperable
OpenStack guest initialization with Python"

Each presentation will last around 30 minutes + Q/A. There will be
short, 10 minute coffee breaks in between sessions.


>Thanks,< p>
See you on February 11!
